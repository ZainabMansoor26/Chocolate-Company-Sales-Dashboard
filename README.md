# Chocolate-Company-Sales-Dashboard (Interactive Power BI Dashboard using MS Excel)
## Overview
This project presents a Power BI sales analytics dashboard for the chocolate company.
- Power BI is a powerful data visualization platform that enables users to transform raw data into insightful reports, share results easily, and collaborate effectively.
- After conducting thorough data analysis, cleaning, and data wrangling in Excel, the dataset was prepared for visualization.
- The dashboards provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, shipment distribution, and product profitability.
## Data Model
The data model is built using a simplified star schema to facilitate effective analysis:
- Five tables Used: a central fact table called 'shipments' and four dimension tables: 'salesperson', 'product', 'geography', and 'calendar' (or date).
- The 'shipment' table has one row per shipment, detailing salesperson, product, geography, date, sales amount, and boxes shipped.
## Key Measures & KPIs
The dashboard features several key performance indicators and measures:
 - Total Sales (Total Revenues)
 - Total Boxes
 - Total Shipments (Count of rows in shipments table)
 - Total Cost (Calculated based on boxes and cost per box from product table)
 - Total Profit (Total Sales minus Total Costs)
 - Profit Percentage
 - Low Box Shipments Count (Shipments with less than 50 boxes)
 - Low Box Shipments Percentage (LBS count divided by total shipments)
 - Month-on-Month Changes for key metrics like sales, boxes, costs, profit, and shipments.
 - Latest Month Sales and Latest Month-on-Month Sales Change for card visuals.
